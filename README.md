Description:
Lightweight straightup CSS &amp; JavaScript Framework. This project is set to be written as a learning curve and a way to put what I consider are good coding practices, an while there is a small attempt to have cross browser support, I'm only focusing on Chrome for the time being because I like it and it's faily advanced in the implementation and support for HTML5 and CSS3.

This project tries to push for normal support without all the vendor prefixes (even though I use them a couple of times) so you will not find it to be cross browser, just thought I should reiterate on that as people freak out about it.

The documentation itself is on the project... the plan is to write a clean framework that works well with the latest browser versions and soon go through the LESS phase so it becomes more intuitive, robust and useful.

Version 1.0.2

  - Updated this document (readme.md). I'm making up for the 3 updates so far, also added the description for the project to make more sense.

  - Removed the borders on the system messages. Still not happy with the colors so I'll change those in the next version again.

  - Added the Emmet Abbreviation code examples to promote it's use, it's awesome!

  - Couple of fixes on the documentation to be more consistent with the verbiage.

  - Fixes the error vs danger class for the system messages class.

  - Made the X on the .close tag into lowercase in the markup and uppercase with CSS for the output.

  - Added a home anchor to the main menu of the documentation

Version 1.0.1

  - Renamed the class for the columns for the fluid grid, it's now done with numerical values.

  - Added the missing markup for the System Messages, Aligment, Buttons, etc.

  - Removed some leftover CSS features that I don't plan on writing right now and added a few ones.

  - Changed the style of the colors for the buttons and the system messages.

  - Made the form elements full width (this needs a lot more work that's on it's way)

  - Changed the style in the titles a bit, they were too bold.

  - Small changes on the .codeIt class so it displays code a little nicer.

Version 1.0

  - It Begins!
